The files required to replicate the first exercise ("FLEXIBLE ASSET ALLOCATION: DETHRONING MOVING AVERAGE RULES?") are:

ESERCIZIO1 → Code for the In-Sample analysis.

ESERCIZIO1_FS → Code for the Full-Sample analysis.

The two files are almost identical, with differences only in the data specification in the first lines.
(I preferred to separate the two samples to ensure greater clarity and comprehension during debugging.)
FAa → Dataset for the Full-Sample analysis.

Book1 → Dataset for the In-Sample analysis.

Nome report es 3 → Report for Exercise 1.
